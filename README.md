# Predicting-Model
# 🌡️ Forecasting Volume-to-Temperature Ratio  
**Course:** CMPT 3830 – Machine Learning Applications  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project focused on analyzing how air temperature influences the volume of product dispensed at fuel sites. A new metric called **Volume-to-Temperature Ratio** was developed to capture this relationship. The project aimed to improve forecasting accuracy and support operational decision-making in fuel logistics.

## 👨‍💻 My Role
- 🧹 Cleaned and prepared dispensing and weather datasets for analysis  
- 🔖 Engineered a three-class label system (Low, Medium, High) to classify temperature-volume behavior  
- 🤖 Built and evaluated machine learning models for both **classification** and **regression** tasks  
- 🌐 Integrated the best-performing model into a **Streamlit web app** for real-time forecasting  
- 🛠️ Contributed to the development of a tool for more informed decisions in fuel site operations  

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Streamlit)  
- Machine Learning (Classification & Regression Models)  
- Data Visualization and Web App Deployment  

## 🎯 Outcome  
The final Streamlit app enables users to input weather data and receive predictions on how temperature might impact fuel dispensing volume, helping operations teams adjust strategies accordingly.
